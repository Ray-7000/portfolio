### Anomaly Detection Algorithm for Healthcare Datasets
[Poster](https://faculty.salisbury.edu/~ealu/reu/Projects_File/2024/AnomalyDetection.pdf)

Co-authored a research report on anomaly detection in healthcare, applying advanced statistical models and collaborative academic writing skills. Parsed and visualized large datasets using a hybrid Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithm in Python, improving anomaly detection accuracy. Designed and deployed a project website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance public accessibility and engagement with research findings

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
