## Projects
### Anomaly Detection Algorithm for Healthcare Datasets
[Poster](https://faculty.salisbury.edu/~ealu/reu/Projects_File/2024/AnomalyDetection.pdf)

Co-authored a research report on anomaly detection in healthcare, applying advanced statistical models and collaborative academic writing skills. Parsed and visualized large datasets using a hybrid Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithm in Python, improving anomaly detection accuracy. Designed and deployed a project website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance public accessibility and engagement with research findings
